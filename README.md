# Timed Code Quiz !

In short, this project is exactly what the title says it is; a small quiz with code-related questions that the user must complete within a time limit.

The purpose was to showcase the skills I've learned at the UCSD bootcamp so far through my use of dynamic html and CSS script powered by Javascript to build this web-app.

*[This project has been deployed on github](https://rickyesc1.github.io/weekfourquiz/)

A brief overview of the features that my application boasts are as follows:
    - 5 Mutiple choice questions 
    - 15 seconds per question to complete the quiz
    - 10 seconds off the clock penalty for wrong answers
    - The ability to store and log high scores with a user's initials (on another page !)
    -Dybamic html, CSS, and JS with the use of event listeners, jquery, json strings, and more functions and operators and variables that I have learned about in the class.

## Motivation !
So just WHY on earth does this application exist? 

Because I believed in myself. 

I was truly struggling with ALL of the concepts covered the first two and a half weeks of class, and it was really discouraging feeling like I was drowning while seeing my classmate's beautifully written and executed assignments. So, I used those feelings of despair to propel myself into a bountiful feeling of motivation, and rewatched class lectures, joined study groups, did the activities over and over and worked away on the homework assignments (even past ones) in order to build my confidence up.
Until finally I had a good enough grasp of the concepts that I could execute this application. 

The other motivation besides proving myself to myself was to get an A on the assignment, as this was a homewor task given to me by the Coding Bootcamp at UCSD.
